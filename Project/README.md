# Punk Wolf

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## About

I am making a shopping website for the brand Punk Wolf. It sells clothes and clothing DIY materials at an affordable price. The target audience is those within the punk/alt/lgbt community looking to find affordable clothes that wont break the bank along with materials to maintain and customise their clothes. I want things to be easily accessible as a lot of people in the communities I want to use my site have disabilities. Using HTML to contain all of the info, CSS to style things, JavaScript to return the newsletter email back to the user and to change the site currency, and EXPRESS to test the site js as I work. I plan on using Clip Studio EX to make an animation for the banner.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to run project

To get the project running using Express, you need to use npm run server:dev. From there enter localhost:9000 into the browser bar

## Planning

### Task: A short paragraph to describe how the project was planned

How did you plan your app? Describe the steps you took to plan your app and include any photos or screenshots of planning you did. This may be photos of sketches you did, personas, trello boards, MOSCOW boards or something else.

## SEO

> my keywords are relevant to the audience I want to attract and include: 

> Links do technically work but have no pages to go to. Without these places existing the links lead to nowhere.

> Page names will be kept short

> I have made efforts to keep the site optimised by keeping image and video file sizes small without compromising on the image quality. The site loads fast because I have not included any content that has no use when loaded

> At this moment in time there is no site-map due to additional pages not yet being created and connected to each other

> I have used appropriate HTML and header names on the HTML side of the website

> there is a newsletter available in the footer for people to sign up to

> if I were launching this product I would:
   - run a blog on the site with blog post previews on facebook and tumblr as a form of evergreen content
   - post short form videos on social media sites such as Tik Tok, Instagram and Facebook
   - interact with users on social media site to keep relevance and stay up to date on trends

> I would invest in ad space on social media sites, especially Tumblr and Tik Tok where I am aware of a huge amount of the punk/alt community spend their time.

## UX and Accessibility

### Task: A list that shows how your website meets accessibility guidelines, and which design principles were considered durng planning.

Talk about which UX and Accessibility principles you considered whilst making this project. Try to provide at least 2 or 3 examples for each. You can find links to relevant reading material, including the slides from the UX presentation is on Slack, but here is a list of a few sample examples to provide some inspiration:

- Did you create persona(s) to help you understand who the users of your product would be? What design decisions did you make based on the persona(s) you used? Include some pictures of the persona/s if you haven't done so already.
- What design patterns did you use, and why? (Remember [www.ui-patterns.com](www.ui-patterns.com))
- What design principles did you use? How did you implement them? 
- Have you ensured all your images have appropriate alt attributes?
- Have you ensured there is sufficient contrast between the text colour and the background behind it?
- Have you ensured the fonts are large enough on all devices?
- Are you using a type-face that is dyslexia friendly?
- Have you used aria tags in your HTML?
- Have you tested how your site is presented to screenreaders to ensure a good user experience?
- Have you avoided features like auto-playing videos, pop ups and large file sizes?
- Can you navigate your project successfully using the keyboard alone?
- Are your links and 'touch points' far enough apart that users don't accidentally click adjacent elements by accident?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> To help me understand the userbase I created personas that I felt represented users who would use my site
   --add image here. Need to take pictures as drawn physically--

> design patterns I used

> I used semantic HTML tags when possible to follow aria guidelines

> I made sure that my site is high contrast and readable for users with visual impairments

> To enable users to use my site without being confused, I made sure to keep the heuristics consistent. It resembles a shopping page on any other site with a search button, shopping basket, and page navigation in the top bar

> links are far enough apart that users shouldn't misclick the wrong items

> all images have alt tags for screen-readers

> I have avoided including pop-ups in my site to keep users on my site

> I have avoided flashing/strobe effects throughout the site including within animations to prevent any photosensitive based reactions among users

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Current To-Do List

> Create animation for a banner

> fix hover over basket icon showing above normal basket icon

> Use JavaScript and API on the currency selector to change the currency across the page

> pick a font to use

> continue formatting with CSS
   - welcome banner aligned to the vertical centre with an animation playing behind it
   - get all products laid out within thumbnails and have thumbnails laid out on the page
   - footer. Links on the left, newsletter in the center, and the money related things on the right. Add a copyright at the bottom

> have a "buy now" button appear on the product image mouseover 

> continue updating readme

> if there is enough time I would like to add a horizontal bar featuring product categories that shows when hovering the product option in the navbar

> optimise site for mobile devices
