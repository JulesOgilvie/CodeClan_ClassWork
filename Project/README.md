## How to run your project

What are the commands you needed to use to get your project up and running? What command do you use to run the server? You want to describe it so that you could clone your project on to another machine in the future and be able to get the project up and running without having to rely on memory.

- Have you used keywords in your project? If so what keywords did you use, and why?
- Page loading - it needs to be fast. What have you done to make your page load as fast as possible? (Think about things like optimising images to keep the file sizes small without compromising quality)
-  Are the pages visually stable, with no shifting about as the page loads?
- Have you optimised your URLs by giving your project pages short, but relevant names?

- What social media strategy would you use if you were launching this project as a real product? (E.g. which social media platforms would you use? How would you want to engage with visitors there?)

## UX and Accessibility

Talk about which UX and Accessibility principles you considered whilst making this project. Try to provide at least 2 or 3 examples for each. You can find links to relevant reading material, including the slides from the UX presentation is on Slack, but here is a list of a few sample examples to provide some inspiration:

- Are you using a type-face that is dyslexia friendly?
- Have you used aria tags in your HTML?
- Have you tested how your site is presented to screenreaders to ensure a good user experience?
- Have you avoided features like auto-playing videos, pop ups and large file sizes?
- Can you navigate your project successfully using the keyboard alone?
- Are your links and 'touch points' far enough apart that users don't accidentally click adjacent elements by accident?

## Tips

Keep is simple. We don't need paragraphs of detail for the list tasks. Here is a suggested format:

> [Principle Name]: [Single sentence about how I used it in the project/planning]

Here's an example of one list item for the SEO list:

> Site speed and technical structure: Optimised image dimensions to keep the file size as small as possible.

Here's another example of one list item for UX:

> Easy to navigate: Included a simple navigation menu that is easy to find, and avoids deeply nested navigation trees.

Here's another example of one list item for Accessibility:

> Perceivable: Ensured all images have alt tags with appropriate descriptions.
