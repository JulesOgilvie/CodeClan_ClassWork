    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a 21 year old, non-binary CodeClan student from <em>Dundee</em>. From 2019 to 2022 I was studying animation in <em>Dundee University</em> but I decided to leave to pursue a different career path so I didn't lose my love for art and animation while developing love for another skill. Eventually, I decided to get back into learning to code after looking at a website with poor accessibility and remembering I enjoyed working with Python and HTML in high school.
    </p>
    <p>In my own time I do still make art and animations, which includes working with my friends on our own projects. You will often also find me playing games, or more recently, volunteering in Dudhope Castle in Dundee where I help at the reception and spend the quiet time taking online coding courses or working on art. I also enjoy taking care of plants and animals and at home.

        My favourite animals are red wolves. No particular reason. I just think they're cool. They're also incredibly endangered with fewer than <em>10 individuals</em> left in the wild.
