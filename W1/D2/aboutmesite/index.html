                <h2>A Bit About Myself</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a 21 year old, non-binary CodeClan student from <em>Dundee</em>. From 2019 to 2022 I was studying animation in <i>Dundee University</i> but I decided to leave to pursue a different career path so I didn't lose my love for art and animation while developing love for another skill. Eventually, I decided to get back into learning to code after looking at a website with poor accessibility and remembering I enjoyed working with Python and HTML in high school.
                </p>

                    "Whit's fer ye 'll no go by ye."
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Since leaving University in February 2022, I have been wracking my brain about how I'm going to move forward. I applied for <em>Universal Credit</em> and they got me with <em>Remploy.</em> Remploy have since been helping me to find courses and funding and they pointed me towards <em>The Circle at Dudhope Castle</em> who I now volunteer for. Ever since, I have been finding many opportunities to get my foot in the door for software and web development. My volunteer coordinator pointed me towards CodeClan for a fully funded 4 week course I am now taking and <i>Remploy</i> have helped me to apply for a paid apprenticeship in Software &amp; Web Development with <em>QA Limited Apprenticeships</em>. In my own time I have been doing online studies in coding languages such as C++, HTML, CSS and HTML as well as sourcing and reading textbooks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my own time I do still make art and animations, which includes working with my friends on our own projects. You will often also find me playing games, or more recently, volunteering in Dudhope Castle in Dundee where I help at the reception and spend the quiet time taking online coding courses or working on art. I also enjoy taking care of plants and animals and at home.

                <p>
                    The red wolf is my favourite animal. No special reason. I just think they're cool.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Not So Fun Fact: </strong>Red wolves are incredibly endangered with fewer than <em>10</em> left in the wild.
